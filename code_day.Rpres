What does this pipeline do?
========================================================

Once you have retrieved all your sequences from the Illumina machine, you will need to asign them to the sample they came from,  and minimize the noise and cross-contamination inherent to this platform.

This pipeline will need the follwing **input** files:

- One or more pairs of fastq files
- A metadata file, with one row per sample, containing the information needed to demultiplex the sequences
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
metadata <- read_csv("data/metadata.csv")
metadata %>% select (sample_id, Tag, pri_index_name, sec_index_seq, file1, file2)
```
- A parameters file, which will be the bridge between the pipeline and the metadata file 

What does this pipeline give you?
========================================================

In return, this pipeline will give you the composition of your samples. The **output** files are:

- ASV_Table: It is in a long format, with three columns: Hash, sample, nReads

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Slide With Plot
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
