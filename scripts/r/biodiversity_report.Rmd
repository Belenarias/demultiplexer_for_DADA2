## This is a quick report on the output of a MiSeq run

To get a report similar to this, with a newly analised dataset, just check yes on the biodiversity report field of the parameters file.


```{r cars}
fastq.folder
library(tidyverse)
sample.map<-read_delim(paste0(fastq.folder,"/sample_trans.tmp"),col_names = c("Full_Id", "fastq_header","Sample"),delim = "\t")
metadata.file<-read.csv(paste0(fastq.folder,"/metadata.csv"),colClasses = "character") %>% 
  as.tibble() %>%
  select(sample_id,Site,Month,biological_replicate,PCR_replicate)
ASV_table<-read_csv((paste0(fastq.folder,"/DUP_table.csv")))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
