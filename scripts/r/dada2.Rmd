## Dada2 report

You have successfully split your libraries into a pair (or two) of fastq files per sample. Now let's import the output of demultiplex_both_fastq.sh  

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
list.files(path = params$folder)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
